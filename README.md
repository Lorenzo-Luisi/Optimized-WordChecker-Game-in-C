### Optimized WordChecker game in C lenguage
The objective of this project is to implement and optimize the performance of the WordChecker game in the C programming language.<br>

The inputs are read from a txt file following the rules described in the pdf: ProvaFinale2022_tema.pdf.
after which the program will process the result using the least possible memory space and in the shortest possible time<br>
Reading from file was done using the features of the C Lion development environment.<br>

Furthermore, the code was checked so as not to have memory leaks and to respect time and memory constraints with the following tools: Valgrind and Address Sanitizer in a Linux (Ubuntu) environment.
